                    <h2>What Does A Computer Programmer Do?</h2>
                    <p>Before we start looking at how to become a programmer, I need to make sure that you have a
                        complete
                        understanding of what a computer
                        programmer does. A programmer is someone who writes code that tells a computer or some other
                        device
                        what
                        to do.</p>
                    <p>
                        In the case of a <b>software developer</b>, they take a concept or design and write the code that
                        tells
                        the
                        computer how to
                        execute this concept. In the case of someone like a <b>web developer</b>, they take a proposed
                        website
                        design
                        and build it by writing the necessary code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In most situations, a <b>computer programmer</b> is building or creating something based on someone
                        else’s
                        design parameters. However, some
                        programmers design their programs, so this is always an option if you’re an entrepreneurial
                        kind
                        of
                        person!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that we have answered the question <em>‘What does a computer programmer do?’</em>, let’s move
                        onto
                        how to
                        learn programming and become a good programmer.

                    <h2>How To Become A Programmer: Step By Step Guide</h2>
                    <p><em>Learning programming is hard</em>, I’m not going to lie. However, when you compare it to other
                        skills
                        and
                        career paths, becoming a
                        programmer will be one of the easiest choices you make!</p>

                      <p>
                        As you can see, there are plenty of reasons why you would want to become a programmer.

                    <p>
                        By the way, one of the best things about learning programming is that there are so many ways
                        to
                        do
                        it.
                        You can enroll in an IT degree program,
                        or start on your own with online courses, exercises, and peer help.

                        Step 1: Understand Why You Want To Start Programming
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The first and one of the most important steps on how to become a programmer is identifying
                        your
                        reasons
                        for
                        starting. Sit down and have a good hard think about the following questions, as your answers
                        will
                        help
                        you decide exactly which path to take:

                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Why do you want to learn programming?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        This is a very important question that you absolutely must ask yourself before you go any
                        further.
                        Do
                        you want to turn it into a career?
                        Do you have a project or concept that you want to turn into a reality on your own?

                    </p>
                    <img src="" alt="">
                    <p>Or do you simply want to learn how to be a programmer because it’s something that’s ‘cool’ at
                        the
                        moment?
                        Answer honestly, because the language
                        that you choose to learn will depend on your answer to this question.</p>
                    <h4>
                        What do you hope to do with your new knowledge?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Again, you need to identify exactly what you want to do with your new programming knowledge.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, the courses you need to take and the languages you need to learn if you want to
                        become
                        a
                        software developer or systems engineer will be a lot different from the skills you need to
                        make
                        a
                        few

                        Are you serious about learning to program? </h4>
                    <p>
                        This a very important question to ask. Are you serious about learning how to become a
                        programmer
                        and
                        in
                        getting a job in the field, <em>or is it just a fad?</em> If you are serious, then you need to be
                        able to
                        allocate as much time as possible to learning programming skills so that you can start
                        working
                        ASAP!

                    </p>
                    <h4>

                    <p>
                        More on this in <b>Step 2</b>, but you need to think closely about what sort of programming you
                        want to
                        do
                        and
                        what field you want to go into.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Do you want to become a <b>back-end web developer?</b> <b>A software engineer?</b> Or do you <b>want to work
                            on something like artificial intelligence (AI)</b> or another emerging technology? The answer to this
                        question will help shape the learning pathway that you take, so be honest with yourself.

                    <p>
                        Once you have answered these questions honestly and recorded your answers, it’s time to <b>move
                            onto step two:</b> choosing what sort of programming you want to do and then we'll move on to the question
                        on how to become a programmer.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Step 2: Decide What Field You Want To Go Into</h3>
                    <p> There are a variety of different types of programming. When you are figuring out how to
                        learn
                        programming, you need to think very carefully about what field you are planning on looking
                        for
                        work
                        in.
                        Some of the most popular types of programmers include:
                    </p>
                    <h4> Web developers</h4>
                    <p> <mark>Web developers</mark> can be further separated into <mark>front-end</mark> (client-side) and <mark>back-end</mark>
                        (server-side)
                        developers. <b>Front-end programmers are responsible for writing the code that dictates what a
                            website

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Back-end programmers are required to write web apps and other complicated programs that

                        usually
                        take
                        a design or a concept that someone else has come up with and write the code to turn it into
                        a
                        working

                        and manipulate scientific data.

                        These
                        specialists are often researchers in their own right, and they often use code to make their
                        job
                        easier.

                    <b>Download a code editor in your browser and write your little programs.</b>
                    </p>
